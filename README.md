Hi Humans!

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

The ES6 section describes the three ES6 feature groups, and details which features are enabled by default in Node.js, alongside explanatory links. It also shows how to find which version of V8 shipped with a particular Node.js release.
